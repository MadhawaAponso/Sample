I need to build a course management system.
these are the key functionalities of this
1. Role based auth
2. Students can see the lectures that they are having in each course with the time and date and place
3. Students can see the upcoming assignments with deadlines. 
4. For each lec there is a attendance marker where student can go and make their attendance there
5. Only lectures can change the time and place of lec
6. Only lec can edit the assigment deadlines and remove or add assignments
This is the rough idea about the project. This can differ. But I need ER diagram for this. can you do that mentioning what are the entities we want. what kind of relation they have
